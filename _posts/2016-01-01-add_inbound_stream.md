This command is similar to pullstream. To add a stream, do the following steps:

1. Enter the stream name and stream source to be added
   
2. Select whether the stream will be forced to TCP or not
   
   ![addinbound]({{site.url}}/assets/addinbound.jpg)
   
3. Click **Add Stream**
   
   ![image4]({{site.url}}/assets/image4.jpg)

**Notes:**

- Stream name is for the localStreamName parameter under pullStream
- Stream source is for the URI under pullStream
- A successful add stream will list the stream under Stream List
