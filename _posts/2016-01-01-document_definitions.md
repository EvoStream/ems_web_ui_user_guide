| **TERM** | **DEFINITION**                           |
| :------: | ---------------------------------------- |
|   API    | Application Programming Interface        |
|   CURL   | A tool to transfer data from or to a server |
|   DASH   | Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP. HTTP adaptive bitrate streaming defined by ISO |
|   EMS    | EvoStream Media Server                   |
|   EWS    | EvoStream Web Server                     |
|   ERS    | EvoStream Rendezvous Server              |
|   HDS    | HTTP Dynamic Streaming. HTTP adaptive bitrate streaming defined by Adobe. |
|   HLS    | HTTP Live Stream. HTTP adaptive bitrate streaming defined by Apple. |
|   HTTP   | Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol. The basic protocol used for web-page loading and web browsing. Also used for tunneling by many protocols. TCP based. |
|   IDR    | Instantaneous Decoding Refresh – This is a specific packet in the H.264 video encoding specification. It is a full snapshot of the video at a specific instance (one full frame). Video players require an IDR frame to start playing any video. “Frames” that occur between IDR Frames are simply offsets/differences from the first IDR |
|   JSON   | JavaScript Object Notation               |
|   Lua    | A lightweight multi-paradigm programming language |
|   MSS    | Microsoft Smooth Streaming. HTTP adaptive bitrate streaming defined by Microsoft. |
|   PHP    | A server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language |
|   RTCP   | Real Time Control Protocol – An protocol that is typically used with RTSP to synchronize two RTP streams, often audio and video streams |
|   RTMP   | Real Time Messaging Protocol – Used with Adobe Flash players |
|  RTMPT   | Real Time Messaging Protocol Tunneled – Essentially RTMP over HTTP |
|   RTP    | Real-time Transport Protocol – A simple protocol used to stream data, typically audio or video data |
|   RTSP   | Real Time Streaming Protocol – Used with Android devices and live streaming clients like VLC or Quicktime. RTSP does not actually transport the audio/video data, it is simply a negotiation protocol. It is normally paired with a protocol like RTP, which will handle the actual data transport |
|  swfURL  | Used in the RTMP protocol, this field is used to designate the URL/address of the Adobe Flash Applet being used to generate the stream (if any) |
|  tcURL   | Used in the RTMP protocol, this field is used to designate the URL/address of the originating stream server |
|   TOS    | Type of Service. This is a field in IPv4 packets used by routers to determine how traffic should be dispersed, usually for prioritizing packets |
|   TTL    | Time To Live. This is a field in Ipv4 packets used by routers to determine how many gateways/routers the packet should be able to pass through. |
|   URI    | Universal Resource Identifier. The generic form of a URL. URI’s are used to specify the location and type of streams. |
|   URL    | Uniform Resource Locator. This is a specific form of the URI used for web browsing (http://ip/page) |
|   VOD    | Video On Demand                          |
