The Send MPEG-TS command allows you to create a UDP based MPEG Transport Stream to some destination. The destination IP can be a unicast, broadcast or multicast address. Be careful not to use a port that is reserved or already in use!

To create a MPEG-TS stream, simply follow these steps:

1. Select a stream under Stream List
   
2. Enter the Target Address where is the stream will be sent
   
3. Enter the Target Port to listen to
